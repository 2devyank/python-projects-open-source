# ASCII-ART

## Description
This Python Project will take a simple image and print out an [ASCII-art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).

## About this Project
This project uses [opencv](https://www.opencv.org) to process image and [numpy](https://numpy.org) to manipulate arrays. The Image is numerically coded for different threshold regions it comes under and for each coded regions, a symbol is used for printing it out in the stdout.

## Usage
Use the Script create_art.py .
In the command line, Enter

`python3 create_art.py [image_path]`

Replace the `[image_path]` with the image you want to do ascii-art.
